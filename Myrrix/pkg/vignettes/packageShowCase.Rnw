\Plaintitle{R interface to Myrrix - Large-scale distributed recommendations}
\Abstract{
This package allows R users to communicate and build recommendation engines using Myrrix (\url{http://myrrix.com}).\\
Myrrix combines the popular real-time Recommender API from Taste/Mahout, and integrates it completely with the distributed implementations begun in Mahout. It is "Taste 3", a continuing evolution of these recommender systems, from the primary author of these components, redesigned into a complete big-data-ready system.\\
For more information on setting up large scale recommendation systems, contact the author.
